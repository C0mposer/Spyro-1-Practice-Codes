# New Menu Features:  
### Disable Portal
With **Disable Portal** enabled, it will automatically load a savestate the moment the camera touches the portal. This allows you to practice portal entries much more effeciently.

If you have manual timer on, the timer will stop the moment the camera touches the portal, allowing you to time portal entries as well.

### Show Sparx Range
With **Show Sparx Range** on, it will draw an octagon around Spyro representing sparx's range for gem collection.

### Track Consistency
With **Track Consistency** on, you can easily keep track of your consistentcy at tricks/hard movement from within the game.
When you turn it on you will notice 2 numbers in the bottom left, a numerator and denominator. 
The numerator represents your successful attempts at something, and the denominator represents your total attempts at something.
Here are the controls:
**Loadstate Button** - Automatically increase total attempts
**Right Stick Up** - Manually increase successful attempts
**Right Stick Down** - Manually decrease successful attempts
**L2 + R2 + Right Stick Up** - Manually increase total attempts
**L2 + R2 + Right Stick Down** - Manually decrease total attempts
**L2 + R2** - Show tracker for 2 seconds
