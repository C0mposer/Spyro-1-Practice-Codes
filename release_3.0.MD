# New Menu Features:  
### Disable Portal
With **Disable Portal** enabled, it will automatically load a savestate the moment the camera touches the portal. This allows you to practice portal entries much more effeciently.

If you have manual timer on, the timer will stop the moment the camera touches the portal, allowing you to time portal entries as well.

### Show Sparx Range
With **Show Sparx Range** on, it will draw an octagon around Spyro representing sparx's range for gem collection.

### Track Consistency
With **Track Consistency** on, you can easily keep track of your consistentcy at tricks/hard movement from within the game.
When you turn it on you will notice 2 numbers in the bottom left, a numerator and denominator. 
The numerator represents your successful attempts at something, and the denominator represents your total attempts at something.
Here are the controls:
**Loadstate Button** - Automatically increase total attempts
**Right Stick Up** - Manually increase successful attempts
**Right Stick Down** - Manually decrease successful attempts
**L2 + R2 + Right Stick Up** - Manually increase total attempts
**L2 + R2 + Right Stick Down** - Manually decrease total attempts
**L2 + R2** - Show tracker for 2 seconds
**Loadstate Button x3** - Reset both total and successful attempts back to 0

# Cosmetic Menu

- Spyro 
- Spyro's Flame 
- Sparx 

Skins included are made by:

# Savestate Improvements:
- Savestate stability across certain levels with moving collision has been improved (ex: High Caves, Jacques, etc). You should see much less crashes in those types of levels.
- In certain levels with moving collision, spyro would sometimes phase through the moving collision. This has been fixed.
- If you hit the savestate hotkey anytime during a dragon cutscene, it will automatically savestate the frame you are back in gameplay after the dragon.
- If you hit the savestate hotkey anytime during a level exit, it will automatically savestate the frame you are back in gameplay coming out of the portal.
- If you exit a level that you have a savestate(s) in, if you do not overwrite that savestate(s) you can still load from it after re-entering that level.

# Bug Fixes
- Sparx will now reset to full health upon looping a level
- Eggs will now reset upon looping a level.
- Savestates will no longer reset upon looping a level.
- The lives icon in the HUD no longer clips at the top of the screen sometimes when loading a savestate.
- Your savestate slot will go back to slot 1 anytime you enter a new level.
- When loading a savestate at the beginning of Tree Tops, spyro will stay locked until the theif cutscene ends.
- For non-full savestate version, respawn + load position macro has been re-added.
