# Bug Fixes
- Skins will now reload on quit game.
- Skins will now reload after balloonist.
- Sparx skins will now reload after looping an IL
- If you have a savestate in a homeworld already made, turning on disable portal won't overwrite it.  
- If you exit a level that you made a savestate in with disable portal on, it will prevent you from trying to load an invalid savestate from that level inside a homeworld.
- Added hotkey to reset consistency counter for PS1/IOP consoles.
